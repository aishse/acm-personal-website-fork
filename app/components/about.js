      <p>
        Hello! I’m Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, founder and CEO of Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated. I specialize in creating -inators — highly specific inventions designed to solve trivial problems, often with unintended consequences. My career began in the small, little-known country of Drusselstein, where I had a less-than-ideal childhood, to say the least. Now, my ongoing (and totally reasonable) quest is to take over the Tri-State Area, all while navigating setbacks like my platypus nemesis and my daughter’s disapproval. I combine science, creativity, and a bit of villainous charm in all my work — aiming for world domination... and perhaps a tiny bit of redemption, but mostly world domination.
